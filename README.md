Penetration Testing Report â€“ Local Network Scan
1. Executive Summary
This report summarizes a local network penetration test performed using Nmap to identify open ports and services running on devices in the network.
â€¢ Purpose of Scan: To discover exposed services and assess potential security vulnerabilities on the local network.
â€¢ Scope: Local network range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24). Targeted live hosts in the same subnet.
2. Methodology
â€¢ Tool Used: Nmap (https://nmap.org)
â€¢ Scan Types:
â€¢	  - TCP SYN Scan (-sS): Stealthy port scan to identify open TCP ports.
â€¢	  - Basic Service Detection: Default Nmap banner grabbing and port mapping.
â€¢	  - Output Captured: Screenshots of Zenmap/Nmap GUI results.
3. Findings
The following hosts were found with open ports:
ðŸ”¹ Host: 192.168.1.1 (likely router)
â€¢ Open Ports:
  - 80/tcp â€“ HTTP
  - 443/tcp â€“ HTTPS
â€¢ Observation: Standard web access ports; possibly admin interface.
ðŸ”¹ Host: 192.168.1.5 (likely a PC or IoT device)
â€¢ Open Ports:
  - 22/tcp â€“ SSH
  - 139/tcp, 445/tcp â€“ SMB (Windows File Sharing)
â€¢ Observation: File sharing exposed; potential vulnerability if not patched.
ðŸ”¹ Host: 192.168.1.20 (unusual)
â€¢ Open Port:
  - 31337/tcp â€“ Unknown/possibly backdoor
â€¢ Observation: Port 31337 is historically used by malware (Back Orifice); should be investigated.

4. Recommendations
â€¢ Port 22 (SSH): Ensure strong password policies or use key-based authentication. Disable root login if not needed.
â€¢ Port 80 (HTTP): Check if it redirects to HTTPS. If not, enforce SSL with port 443 to prevent data leakage.
â€¢ Ports 139/445 (SMB): Disable file sharing if not required. Ensure all patches are applied to prevent exploitation (e.g., EternalBlue).
â€¢ Port 31337 (Suspicious): Investigate the host. If this port is not intentionally open, it may indicate malware or a compromised system.
